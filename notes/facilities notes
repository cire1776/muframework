Then an empty inventory window opens
And the player can transfer fruits into press.

Given a press that has output
When player sneak uses the press
Then a message "Press is in use" appears

Given a loaded press,
When player uses the press

Well
====
well x, y "A water well" {
    fluid: 0=dry, 1=water, 2=oil, 3=bedrock
    depth: 100
    chance_of_drying_up: 5000
    chance_of_hitting_water: 100
    chance_of_hitting_oil: 50_000
    chance_of_hitting_bedrock: 50_000
}
    operational(fluid is 1): has hit water.  if user has :can_fill they will fill water with 30 second timer.
    drilling: looking for water. each dig has a 1in x chance of hitting water.  if user has :can_drill they will dig
        for 60 seconds which will deepen the well by 1 foot.

    drilling wells uses engineering skill.  wells can be 1-3000 feet deep.  1 7 14 28 35 42 45
        ordinary wells are less than 1000 feet deep.  Master wells are those deeper than 1000 feet.
        once bedrock has been reached only a master engineer can drill further.
